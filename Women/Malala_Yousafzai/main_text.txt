Malala Yousafzai was born in Mingora, Pakistan in 1997. She is known for her activism on the right to education, especially female education thoughout the world. Young Malala went to a small girls' school in her town in Swat Valley. However, when the Taliban took over in 2008 they banned girls from attending school; imposing harsh punishments on those that defied their orders. Malala not content with this openly spoke out against the regime and in October, 2012 a Taliban assasin shot her and two other girls on the way home from taking an exam. Malala was rushed to hospital in Rawalpindi Cantonment, Pakistan then transferred to the UK where, after months of surgery, she woke up and rejoined her family in their new home in Birmingham. Following the incident, Malala along with her Father established the <a href="https://www/malala.org">Malala Fund</a> dedicated to giving every girl an opportunity to achieve the future she chooses. For her work in establishing this fund she was jointly awarded the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize with Kailash Satyarthi an Indian Children's rights activist becoming the youngest ever Nobel Laureate. At the time of writing she was continuing her work with the Malala Fund and studying Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.
